# SimonGame

I wanted to create the Simon Game to practice my JavaScript and jQuery skills. The Simon Game is a classic memory game where players must repeat a sequence of colors and sounds. You can find the official rules of the game on the [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simon_(game)).

## Getting Started

To play the game, you can follow these steps:

1. Clone the game repository from GitHub.
2. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.

## How to Play

Once you have the game running in your browser, you can play it in two different ways:

### Mouse Input

- Click on the colored buttons to mimic the sequence displayed by the game.
- Pay attention to the order in which the colors light up and reproduce the same pattern.

### Keyboard Input

- Use the keyboard keys to mimic the pattern:
  - 'g' for the top-left green button
  - 'r' for the top-right red button
  - 'y' for the bottom-left yellow button
  - 'b' for the bottom-right blue button

## Have Fun!

Enjoy playing the Simon Game and see how good your memory and reflexes are.
